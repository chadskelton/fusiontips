## fusiontips - search and hover examples

These two examples should work once you plug in your own Fusion Tables API key which you can obtain [here](https://code.google.com/apis/console)

Upload the fusiontips.js file to the same folder where the HTML file is located.

To make this work with your own Fusion Table map, adjust lines 35 to 45 to reflect your own Fusion Table tableid, the column that contains the geometry info and other specifications.
