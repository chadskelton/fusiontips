## fusiontips - search and hover examples

These two examples should work once you plug in your own Fusion Tables API which you can get [here](https://code.google.com/apis/console)

Upload the fusiontips.js file to the same folder where the HTML file is located.

Adjust lines 35 to 45 with your own Fusion Table tableid, the column that contains the geometry info and other specifications.
